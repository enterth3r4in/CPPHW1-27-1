There are three seating categories at a stadium. 
For a softball game, Class A seats cost $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9. 
Write a program that asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold, then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales. 
Format your dollar amount in a fixed-point notation with two decimal points and make sure the decimal point is always displayed.
